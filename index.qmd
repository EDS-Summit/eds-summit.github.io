Environmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to investigating and answering environmental questions with modern data science tools. The field is broad, diverse, and expanding. This Summit aims to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to lay the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative transdisciplinary community.

The goals of the Summit are to **build community** and **foster collaboration** within the Environmental Data Science community. This year's theme is **Turning Data into Action:** How can we bridge the gap between environmental data science and real-world applications, especially in support of policy, management, and community engagement?
