    "text": "January 27-29, 2026 | Santa Barbara, CA\nHosted by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis\n\nEnvironmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to investigating and answering environmental questions with modern data science tools. The field is broad, diverse, and expanding. This Summit aims to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to lay the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative transdisciplinary community.\nThe goals of the Summit are to build community and foster collaboration within the Environmental Data Science community. This year’s theme is Turning Data into Action: How can we bridge the gap between environmental data science and real-world applications, especially in support of policy, management, and community engagement?\n\n\n\nParticipation\nApplications are now open. Please fill out the application materials by October 8, 2025\nParticipation is limited to 100 attendees, with an application required. We are able to provide funding for up to 60 participants. Funding will cover travel to Santa Barbara, lodging, and the Summit registration fee. In order to attend you must first apply. Applications will be used both to select participation and award funding.\nParticipant attendance is not limited by sector, discipline, background, or career stage. If you use data to ask questions about our environment and how we interact with it, this Summit is for you!\n\n\n\nAgenda\nComing soon\n\n\nSteering Committee\nBen Halpern | Elizabeth Wolkovich | Noam Ross | Amanda Whitmire | Susan Shingledecker | Dawn Wright | Dorris Scott | Leah Wasser\n\nA Research Coordination Network, hosted by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and funded by the National Science Foundation.\nSign up to receive information about the Summit"

    "text": "Despite pandemic delays, about 100 participants gathered in Santa Barbara to kick off the inaugural Environmental Data Science Summit hosted by NCEAS. What struck me most, both in the two days we shared together and beyond, was how empowering it was to come together as a community. After years of limited in-person meetings, it was exciting to connect with familiar faces and especially make new acquaintances. But the empowerment I felt went beyond simply returning to old norms of gathering in person, this group was unique. The voices in the room represented a new, more diverse environmental data science community. It was personally inspiring to see what a future for our community could be.\nTaking an “unconference” approach, we quickly started brainstorming how we could make this vision a reality by promoting diversity, equity, inclusivity, and justice within environmental data science. It was extremely energizing to see the breadth and ambition of ideas brought forward and the quick progress groups were able to make.\nWith lots of buzz surrounding the recent release of ChatGPT, a group of us were excited to talk about the ways that our community can proactively engage and explore the implications of generative AI more broadly for DEIJ in environmental data science. With perspectives from computer science, ecology, earth science, and education, our discussions were a fun mix of the deeply esoteric (what is the role of a data scientist after all?) and silly (now, what does ChatGPT have to say about that?). Keep an eye for a commentary we’re working on opening the conversation with the broader environmental data science community about responsible engagement with generative AI tech in our research and teaching. We’re hoping this is just a starting place and empowers a larger dialogue!\nIn my opinion, the first Summit was a great success, can’t wait for next year’s!\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants enjoyed views of the Pacific Ocean during the Summit"
